# TODO

## DAT check & fix

* Bios check must not come from biosmatch but from the game's own bios property
* Also check romof property
* In merged romset, clones are in folders inside the parents
* Extract missing related files into its own GameRom.RelatedFiles property
* Rename all variables and action parameters because they're confusing
* Copy all files during repair, even correct ones

## UI

* Regroup "missing file in zip" errors
* Translate progression messages
