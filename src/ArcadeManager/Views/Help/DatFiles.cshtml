<h2>Why are DAT files not supported?</h2>

<p>
    DAT (XML) files, used by tools like MAME and CLR MAME Pro, are a great tool to check, rebuild and
    convert romsets.
</p>

<p>
    However, my goal is to have an easy-to-use software, and DAT files cannot be edited easily.
    Plus, they lack many useful informations: screen resolution, arcade hardware
    (Bally/Midway, CPS X, Sega System X...), emulation status, game type, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Using a CSV file (wether exported from <a href="http://adb.arcadeitalia.net/lista_mame.php?lang=en" class="blank">ArcadeItalia</a>
    or completely custom-made) allows anyone with Excel (or any text editor) to filter the lists and
    create their own custom collection. You can even share them using Google Sheets.
</p>

<p>
    You can <a asp-controller="Csv" asp-action="ConvertDat" class="navmenu">convert a DAT file to a CSV file</a> using this tool, if you already have a DAT file that
    you like to use.
