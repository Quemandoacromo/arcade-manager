<h3>Arcade emulators tips & tricks</h3>

<p>
    Just a few random tips that might come handy.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        If at the start of the game you see weird things appearing (lines, artifacts, loading screen,
        "system check", etc), don't panic, it's normal: the emulators also emulate the booting sequences
    </li>
    <li>
        In MAME, you can use a keyboard to open the ingame menu using TAB, or various submenus
        using function keys
    </li>
    <li>
        Check the DIP switches, they will allow you to change difficulty, number of lives, and
        even sometimes activate cheats
    </li>
    <li>
        NeoGeo games don't use DIP switches, and instead you must open the system's BIOS to change
        settings like difficulty. In MAME it's in the TAB menu, in FBNeo you press start a few seconds
        while the game is launching
    </li>
    <li>
        There is a free NeoGeo bios replacement with more options called
        <a href="http://unibios.free.fr/" class="blank">Unibios</a>, it will allow you to switch
        between the arcade and home console version of the games (not sure if you can do it with the
        default BIOS).
    </li>
</ul>
