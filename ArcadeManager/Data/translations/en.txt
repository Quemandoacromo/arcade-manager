Sometimes gameplay is possible but not ideal without a dedicated control (ex: racing games).</p><p>Note that the various "tops" have duplicates: selecting the top200 and the top50 will only result in 200 games, since the top50 is a sub-selection of the top200.<br />Obviously the "tops" are highly subjective, and mainly destined to people who don't know much about arcade games.
